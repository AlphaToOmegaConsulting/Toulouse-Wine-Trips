# Drop New Pictures Here

If you want to replace a picture on the website:

1. Put the new picture file into this folder: `images_to_update`
2. Tell me the file name (for example: `my-new-photo.png`) and where it should be used (for example: “Contact page, top-right image”).

That’s it. I will:
- Rename it to the website’s standard file name (page + location)
- Place it in the right website folder
- Update the website so it shows the new picture

Tips:
- Please upload **one file per request**
- Best formats: `.png` or `.jpg`
- If you can, use a square image for square picture areas
